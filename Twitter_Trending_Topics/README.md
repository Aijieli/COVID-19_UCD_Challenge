# Twitter Trending Scraping
Due to the limitation of Twitter Trending API (7-Day), we scraped [trendogate.com] (https://trendogate.com/placebydate/2352824/), a website archievd trending topics for each day since 2015. We retrieved trending topics from Jan. 20th to April 11th (83 days) with 4,151 trending topics. With the Twitter trending topics in this period, we can study how people on Twitter act during COVID2019. 

# WOEID 
The Twitter Trending API and also trendogate.com both use Yahoo's WOEID as the location ID. We scraped a list of WOEID of USA cities.
