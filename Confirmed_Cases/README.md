# Confirmed Cases
The time series data of confirmed COVID2019 cases is used for study how people on Twitter and news articles would behave with the increasing of the number of confirmed cases. We obtained the data from [Johns Hopkins CSSE] (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The date range we used in from Jan 16th to April 11th. With runing the code, the data can be updated to the lastes version of the dataset.
